Slappity is a game in which a random MAX value is generated when the game starts. 
Two player will have 3 turns each to accumulate scores together till the random MAX value is hit.
After each turn the score is displayed in binary with the right most LED as the least significant digit (2^0). 
A single beep will mean the player has played one turn and two beeps will indicate to switch player.
The first player to hit the randomly generated MAX score loses and will be slapped in the face with a rubber gloves and then a melody will be played and game restarts. 

The change in speed at which the light moves and how much the score will accumulate each turn goes accordingly:
RED LED will increase the total score by 2, but the speed will stay at the current speed.
GREEN LED will increase the total score by 1 but the speed will only increase by one notch.
BLU LED will not increase the total score, but the speed will jump to the fastest speed.
There are 4 speed levels: {slowest, slow, fast, fastest}.
